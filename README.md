My career objective is to work in a challenging position wherein my technical and management skills can be used for the growth of the organization as well as to enhance my knowledge.<br>
I'm specifically interested in data and things that revolve around it.<br> 
I have worked with various programming languages in my curriculum such as **C, JAVA, Python, JavaScript etc** alongside data visualisation tools like **Tableau, Power BI**.<br>
I've been practicing <b>Statistics</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>Data Visualisation</b>, etc frequently as a daily chunk of life.
Speaking about roles that I'm specifically interested in are <b>Data Analyst</b> or <b>Data Scientist</b>.<br>
Just wanted an oppurtunity wherein I can apply my knowledge wherever it is possible.
